# 🎓 CS50 2025

This repository documents my progress through **Harvard’s CS50x (Introduction to Computer Science)** in 2025.  
It serves as a personal workspace for tracking assignments, notes, experiments, and reflections as I work through the course material.

⚠️ **Note**: This repo is for **personal learning only**.  
Do not use it to copy solutions if you’re taking CS50 yourself — that violates the academic honesty policy. Always try solving on your own first!

## 🎯 Goals

- Build a strong foundation in computer science.  
- Improve problem-solving skills in multiple languages (C, Python, SQL, JavaScript).  
- Develop the habit of documenting and reflecting on learning.  
- Create a reference I can revisit in the future.

## 🚀 Tech & Tools

- **Languages:** C, Python, SQL, JavaScript, HTML/CSS  
- **Tools:** VS Code, Git, GitHub, CS50 IDE (when necessary)  
- **Environment:** Local dev setup (Windows + WSL / VS Code)

## 📌 Next Steps

- ✅ Set up repository and structure  
- 🚧 Work through each week’s lectures & problem sets  
- 🚧 Take detailed notes for future reference  
- 🚧 Complete and document the final project
